# Assets Folder

This folder is reserved for any future image assets you might want to add to the Splashy Bear Water Tracker.

## Potential Assets:
- Custom bear illustrations
- Background textures
- Icon sets
- Logo files

Currently, the project uses CSS-based graphics and emoji for all visual elements, so no external assets are required.
